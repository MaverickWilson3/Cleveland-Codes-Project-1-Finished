# Cleveland-Codes-Project-1-Finished
Hello everyone! This was my first coding project. 
I was asked to complete a number of comprehensive tasks.
This project took a while to complete because I had to figure out how to complete the steps by myself. 
The internet hecame my best friend. 
I gained much information from websites like w3schools.com, Youtube, and Google.
A difficult challenge I faced was completing task #9 "Adding a JavaScript alert pop up so that when you click the X to delete a task, a pop message says "Are you sure you want to delete this task?"
This was hard to complete because everytime I would put in the code for an alert, my program would not work. 
After hours of testing, I recieved help from one of my collegues (Seth) who showed me his solution to the code.
Surprisingly, I tried the same exact code on my first attempts and it wouldn't work.
However, when I tried it this time, the code worked.
Overall, I had much fun beginning my coding career.
I look forward to sharing more coding projects in the future.
